            Hi there! I'm **Sashi**, a passionate full-stack developer with a strong background in frontend and mobile app development. Let me introduce myself and tell you more about my journey in tech.

            I am from India, where I cultivated a deep interest in software and systems from a young age. My fascination with building interactive applications led me to pursue a career in development.

            Besides coding, I enjoy learning about new tech trends, exploring the outdoors, and occasionally gaming or reading tech blogs to stay sharp. I’m also passionate about building practical solutions that solve real-world problems and make users' lives easier.
